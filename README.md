# Arabic Sentiment Analysis using AraBERT 


Welcome to the Arabic Sentiment Analysis project powered by AraBERT! This repository contains an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) project that focuses on analyzing sentiment in Arabic text. Leveraging the power of AraBERT, a state-of-the-art language model for the Arabic language, we have built a robust sentiment analysis system capable of understanding and classifying emotions within Arabic text.

# What is Sentiment Analysis?
Sentiment analysis is a fascinating area of NLP that involves understanding and classifying the emotions expressed in a given text. It allows us to determine whether a piece of text conveys a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, providing valuable insights into public opinion, customer feedback, and more.

# Features
- User-friendly web interface.
- Analyze text reviews to determine sentiment.
- Outputs sentiment classification (Positive/Negative) and confidence percentage.

#  Project's Stages

### Data Ingestion from MongoDB:
We have implemented data ingestion functionalities to fetch Arabic text data from MongoDB, making it easy to work with large datasets efficiently.

### Data Validation and Transformation: 
Prior to model training, we perform data validation and transformation to ensure the dataset is clean, balanced, and suitable for training the sentiment analysis model.

### Fine-tuned Model: 
We fine-tuned the MARBERTv2 model using a large dataset of labeled Arabic text for sentiment analysis to accurately capture the linguistic nuances in Arabic. In addition, I evaluated other transformer-based models, including CAMeL-Lab/bert-base-arabic-camelbert-da-sentiment and AraBERT, along with traditional approaches such as XGBoost and Random Forest. While XGBoost and Random Forest achieved validation accuracies of around 68%, MARBERTv2 delivered an impressive 87.79% accuracy. For a detailed view of the experimental setup and results, please refer to the Colab notebook:

### Model Training and Evaluation:
The fine-tuned model undergoes extensive training using the prepared dataset. We evaluate the model's performance using various metrics to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

### Model Pusher:
Once the model training and evaluation are complete, we implement a model pusher component that allows for easy deployment of the trained model to the web application.

### Web Application Development:
We have developed a FastAPI web service that serves as the backbone of our sentiment analysis application. The web app interacts with the sentiment analysis model and allows users to input Arabic text to obtain sentiment analysis results in real time.

# Setup and Installation
1) Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AhmedRabie01/Arabic-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Arabic-BERT.git

```
2) Set Up Virtual Environment 
```bash 
conda create --name myenv -c conda-forge python=3.11
```
3) Activate your Environment 
```bash
Conda activate -name  of your Environment-
``` 
4. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Start the Application
```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
### Notes:

- If you need to train the model you should set up MongoDB and provide the necessary connection details in the configuration files to enable data ingestion if you need to trian the model
